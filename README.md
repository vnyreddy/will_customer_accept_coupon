## Will the customer accept the coupon?
This is the demonstration of detail analysis and data visualization by using Python, Pandas, and plotting libraries.
The Coupon.csv data is from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. A details description of the data is provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

This notebook https://github.com/vnyreddy/will_customer_accept_coupon/blob/main/practical_application.ipynb contains a detailed demonstration of data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization, and finding some of the hidden details about the data, some of them listed as following summery.

* There are only 41% of drivers accept bar coupons. Those drivers who go to Bar more often tend to accept more, which is 76.88% of drivers who goes to Bar more than 3 times per month.

* In another analysis, comparing younger(less than 25) and older(more than 25) drivers, interestingly younger drivers tend to accept 39% of coupons more than older drivers, comparing only 26% in an older population.

* Also, another analysis reveals that there is no effect on accepting bar coupons for drivers who visit the bar more than once if passengers were not a kid, not widowed, or under 30.

* The conclusion of bar coupon analysis, people who go to Bar more often accepts coupon more, and variables like no kid passengers, no widowed, and occupation other than farming, fishing, or forestry has not much effect on the coupon acceptance proportion.

* One analysis concludes a few key points about the customer accepting restaurant coupons and carry-out in relation to the customer traveling with them.

* Interestingly there is not much difference in the carryout coupon acceptance proportions in relation to whom customers travel, although it is worth mentioning that there is slightly less proportion accepting carryout coupons when traveling with kids.

* On the other hand, the proportions of the expensive and less expensive restaurants are surprising, the proportions of accepting less expensive coupons are significantly higher irrespective of whom they travel with, though traveling friends high percentage accepting less expensive restaurants coupons. Whereas traveling with a parter tends to interest more towards more expensive restaurants.
